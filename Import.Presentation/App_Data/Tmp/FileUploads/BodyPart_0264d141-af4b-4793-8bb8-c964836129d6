The product key is not embedded with Visual Studio 2013. When you launch the product, you can simply sign in with the Microsoft account associated with your MSDN subscription and your IDE will automatically activate. An added benefit of signing in to Visual Studio is that your IDE settings will sync across devices, and you can connect to online developer services. If youâ€™d rather enter a product key, then simply bypass signing in and enter the product key found here by selecting Register Product under the Help menu.
